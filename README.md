## Hi there 👋
AI Engineer & Backend Specialist (Python, FastAPI) focused on building production-grade intelligent systems. I combine robust backend architecture with advanced AI integrations, orchestrating local agents via Ollama, RAG, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Leveraging my unique background in Applied Linguistics, I optimize NLP workflows and prompt engineering, deploying scalable, containerized solutions using Docker and Linux for high-performance inference.
