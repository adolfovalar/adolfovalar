## Hi there 👋
I am a passionate software developer focused on building scalable web technologies and automating complex processes. My current focus is on the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence, where I explore and apply models using Ollama and RAG techniques to build smarter solutions.

I have solid experience across the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC), from designing architectures (both monolithic and microservices) and implementing containerization, to configuring Linux servers. I enjoy working across the full stack to transform ideas into functional and efficient products.
