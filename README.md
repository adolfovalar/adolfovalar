## Hi there 👋
Backend Engineer specialized in building robust RESTful APIs using Python, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL. I have experience navigating both monolithic and microservices architectures, ensuring efficient deployment via Docker and Linux. With a unique background in Applied Linguistics, I am currently expanding my technical scope by exploring and implementing practical AI integrations (Ollama, RAG, MCP) to enhance backend systems, aiming to deliver high-quality code and immediate value.
